## Welcome to the 2019 BTCR Hackathon

## What is BTCR?

Our medium article [BTCR Method Updates](https://medium.com/@kimdhamilton/btcr-did-method-updates-d0fd14386139) has a summary of the BTCR (Bitcoin Reference) DID (Decentralized Identifier) method, progress so far, and next steps. It also contains links to the latest BTCR documentation and libraries. 

## Who is involved with BTCR?

Our ongoing work is primarily volunteer-based. We are a ragtag bunch of well-meaning, quasi-cypherpunk/cryptoanarchic, yet exceedingly goofy folks, committed to supporting privacy and individual rights through development of an independent and fully open DID method. Some critical aspects of our work (mobile wallet, library development) have been furthered by support from from Blockchain Commons, Digital Contract Design, and the Shuttleworth Foundation.

We are eager to get more people involved, and this hackathon will be a great opportunity to exchange ideas with others interested in BTCR. 

## What to expect

We will kick off the hackathon with our first remote sync up (details below). There we'll introduce ourselves, interests, and develop a rough game plan for the week. The core devs will be available to answer questions and collaborate on design.

We have quite a few specific outcomes we'd like to achieve, but we encourage you to bring your own suggestions as well. We are looking for all kinds of participants -- not just developers. For example, if you are interested in these ideas, and you love writing, translating to non-technical audiences, or distilling complex concepts, we would love for you to join us.

## Proposed Hackathon Activities

- Writing about BTCR / outreach
- Documentation and samples
- Other developer-focused documentation (e.g. Jupyter notebook)
- Examples of Verifiable Credentials and E2E demonstration of DIDs with Verifiable Credentials
- Update resolvers and libraries to support update and delete operations
- Development of a BTCR wallet/mobile app
- Update playground to support easier creation of BTCR testnet DIDs (e.g. a hosted service backed with faucet funds)
- Connect playground to golang BTCR REST api

## What's next

We are timing this hackathon to gain momentum in advance of [Rebooting Web of Trust 9 in Prague](https://eventbrite.com/e/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-ix-2019b-prague-tickets-63443365815). We won't finish all the activities above, but the hackathon should help us make progress and transfer knowledge to a broader group of new BTCR contributers.
